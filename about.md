I am a current MS Computer Science student at DePaul University. I was previously on the path to become a physical therapist 
but felt my interests better aligned with CS. I decided after working on the front-end of tech (read: support,)
I decided I wanted to find out how things work under the hood and decided to pursue tech.

My academic interests include: complex distributed systems, blockchain, and search engine technology.

Outside of academics I enjoy snowboarding, powerlifting, and hiking.
